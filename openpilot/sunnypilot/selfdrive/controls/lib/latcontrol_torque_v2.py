# release-window output delta vs v0 was 1.45, ~5x the route's other release windows).
# The model trajectory separates road from revision: the request is the plan sampled at
# modeld's lat_action_t = lat_delay + PLAN_ACTION_OFFSET (floored by MIN_STABLE_DELAY), and

# equals the differencer (exactly for curvature-linear plans; within ~0.1 m/s^3 on real
# road features, sharp S-flicks excepted) — but a revision moves both samples
# together and cancels instead of reading as jerk. The differencer stays as the fallback,
# blended in by request-vs-plan divergence: turn assist, lane-change smoothing and
# clip_curvature shape the request without touching the trajectory, and the raw plan would
# fight them (a turn-assist hold floors the request while the plan collapses — pure plan
# jerk would unwind the held wheel). In those shaped regimes the request is rate-limited
# smooth by construction, so the differencer cannot snap there; revisions happen in the
